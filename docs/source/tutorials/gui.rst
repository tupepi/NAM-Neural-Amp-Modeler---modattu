Training locally with the GUI
=============================

After installing NAM locally, you can launch the GUI trainer from a terminal 
with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nam

Training with the GUI requires a reamp based on one of the standardized training
files:

* `v3_0_0.wav <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pgf8PdE0rKB1TD4TRPKbpNo1ByR3IOm9/view?usp=drive_link>`_ 
  (preferred)
* `v2_0_0.wav <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnyJP_IZ7NuyDSTJfn-Jmc5lw0IE7nfu/view?usp=drive_link>`_
* `v1_1_1.wav <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CMj2uv_x8GIs-3X1reo7squHOVfkOa6s/view?usp=drive_link>`_
* `v1.wav <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxwTHOCx3Zf03DggAsuDTcVqsgokNyhm/view?usp=drive_link>`_

.. note:: To train a batch of models, pick all of their reamp (output) files.
