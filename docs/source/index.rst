Welcome to ``neural-amp-modeler``'s documentation!
==================================================

``neural-amp-modeler`` is a Python package for creating neural network models of
your guitar (bass, etc) gear. It works by using two audio files--an input "DI"
file as well as an output "reamp" file, showing how the gear responds to
different incoming signals.
